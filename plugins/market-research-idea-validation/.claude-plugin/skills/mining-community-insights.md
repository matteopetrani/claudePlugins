# Mining Community Insights

## Overview

This skill analyzes online communities to uncover user pain points, feature requests, and market demand signals for your product category.

## Configuration

Before starting, read the "Key Communities" section from `domain-config.md` to identify:
- Reddit subreddits to analyze
- Facebook groups to research
- Other platforms (Discord, forums, etc.)
- Search keywords for discovery

## Evidence standards

- Cite sources for each theme or insight.
- Use this citation format: `[Source Name](URL) - accessed YYYY-MM-DD`

## Data handling and ethics

- Use only public content.
- Anonymize quotes and remove usernames or identifying details.
- Do not include content from private or closed groups without explicit user permission.

## Analysis process

1. **Search communities** for relevant discussions using search keywords from domain-config.md
2. **Extract signals**:
   - Common pain points with existing solutions
   - Feature requests and unmet needs
   - Domain-specific content interests (per domain-config.md analysis dimensions)
   - Sentiment toward competitors
   - User personas and demographics
3. **Synthesize findings** into themes with supporting quotes (anonymized)

If sources are inaccessible, ask the user for links, screenshots, or curated threads and proceed only with what is provided.

## Output format

Create `research/community-insights.md` with:
- Key findings organized by theme
- Pain points with frequency indicators
- Feature requests and demand signals
- Competitor sentiment
- Sample quotes and evidence
- Emerging user personas
- Sample size and timeframe (e.g., number of posts and date range)
- Evidence citations for each theme
- Limits and unknowns

## Success criteria

- Analyzed 50+ relevant discussions (or fewer with documented limits)
- Identified 3-5 key pain points with evidence
- Documented user sentiment toward existing solutions
- Created preliminary personas
- Used public content only and anonymized quotes
- Evidence and citations included for key claims
